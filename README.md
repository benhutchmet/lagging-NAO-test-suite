Test rose suite for creating a lagged ensemble with aligned validation periods. 

For example, initialization in s1963 would include:

* s1963 - year 2-9 mean - period from Dec 1964 to Mar 1972
* s1962 - year 3-9 mean - period from Dec 1964 to Mar 1971
* s1961 - year 4-9 mean - period from Dec 1964 to Mar 1970
* s1960 - year 5-9 mean - period from Dec 1964 to Mar 1969

Increases the ensemble size (quadruples the members) at the expense of relying on persistence.
